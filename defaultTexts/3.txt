Open sauce software is very delicious!
While chefs in 'the business' make very delicious sauce software too,
there's a unique little charm to open source software,
where anyone can kind of contribute to making the recipes better,
or if they please, they may 'fork' the recipe into something they prefer.
The only part which is a drag, is you need to have equipment to begin cooking.
