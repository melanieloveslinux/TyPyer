Time is an illusion that helps things make sense
So we are always living in the present tense
It seems unforgiving when a good thing ends
But you and I will always be back then
You and I will always be back then

Singing, will happen, happening, happened
Will happen, happening, happened
And will happen again and again
'Cause you and I will always be back then
You and I will always be back then
