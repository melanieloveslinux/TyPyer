TyPyer

Type higher with TyPyer!

(Okay, yes terrible jokes aside)

TyPyer is a typing game made in Python with the Tkinter library.  TyPyer is intended to be fairly simplistic and lightweight.  Any genuine feedback is appreciated!

# Set-up
To make TyPyer work you simply need Python and Tkinter installed.  Here's a short guide on how to install them:

Windows:
- Python:  Python can be downloaded from the official website, [click here to visit](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Tkinter:  Tkinter works perfectly fine after Python is installed. (:

Linux:
- Python:  Good news, Python comes with Linux out of the box!
- Tkinter:  I'm sorry for other Distros but on Arch, run the command `pacman -S tk` then Tkinter should work perfectly fine.
